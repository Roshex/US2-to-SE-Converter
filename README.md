# US2 to SE File Converter
A work in progress consol application that converts Universe Sandbox 2 simulation files to Space Engine's .sc files. The program currently does not actually work because .sc files do not support state vectors for velocity and position in place of traditional orbital variables. That, and some other fancy technical bullshit that makes this conversion quite difficult. 

In the future, I'm hoping Space Eninge releases an update allowing objects to be defined by their position and velocity relative to the system center and to use that information to calculate orbits and barycenters. When that happens, this program will work.
